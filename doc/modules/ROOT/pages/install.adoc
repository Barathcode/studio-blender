== Installation

=== 1. Install Blender

There are many Blender versions out there, we always support compatibility with the https://www.blender.org/download/lts/[latest Long Term Support (LTS) release]. This is currently the 2.83.x version which can be downloaded from the given link.

=== 2. Acquire Skybrush Studio for Blender

*Skybrush Studio for Blender* can be purchased from https://skybrush.io. If you obtain a valid licence, the latest plugin installation package can be downloaded from our site as a single `.zip` file. Please download it to your local computer first.

1. Open Blender and go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons.
2. (optional) Activate the "User" filter for the add-ons.
3. Press the "Install..." button on the top right.
4. In the popup window select the *Skybrush Studio Plugin for Blender* `.zip` file that you have downloaded previously to your computer, and press Enter.
5. Activate the "Interface: Skybrush Studio" add-on by clicking on the checkbox next to this item in the add-on list.

== Installing updates

If you have already installed *Skybrush Studio Plugin for Blender* and you receive an update for it, simply follow the same installation procedure as before to overwrite old files with new ones.

NOTE: It might happen that the structure of the plugin also changes which might result in update failure. If you experience any error in the update process, try to completely uninstall the old add-on first manually (as described below) and then re-install the new one from scratch.

== Uninstall

If you decide to uninstall *Skybrush Studio Plugin for Blender* for any reasons, you have to do it manually as Blender does not support uninstall procedure for add-ons officially for the time being. The manual process is as follows:

1. Find the default add-on path for your Blender installation. You can follow the https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html[official Blender guide] for that.
2. Remove all files that are related to the add-on you want to remove. In case of *Skybrush*, besides the actual add-on `.py` Python files, you should also search for `vendor/skybrush` to remove locally installed dependencies.
