*Skybrush Studio for Blender* is a platform independent tool, just like
Blender. The installation procedure is the same for Linux, macOS and Windows.
Please follow the steps below.

== Installation

=== 1. Check hardware requirements

We suggest to follow the https://www.blender.org/download/requirements/[official Blender recommendation] for choosing your computer on which you want to run Blender and *Skybrush Studio for Blender*.

An additional requirement is that you need to have active Internet connection on your computer as *Skybrush Studio* needs to communicate with the *Skybrush Studio Server* for certain tasks such as planning transitions or creating exports in Skybrush compiled show format. You may use the software without Internet connection, but certain functions that require an Internet connection will not be available until you go online again.

=== 2. Install Blender

There are many Blender versions out there, we aim for compatibility with the https://www.blender.org/download/lts/[latest Long Term Support (LTS) release]. This is currently version 2.83.x.

=== 3. Acquire Skybrush Studio for Blender

*Skybrush Studio for Blender* can be purchased from https://skybrush.io. If you obtain a valid licence, the latest installation package can be downloaded from our site as a single `.zip` file. Please download it to your computer first.

=== 4. Install Skybrush Studio for Blender

*Skybrush Studio for Blender* may come in one of two formats: either as a single ZIP file containing the code of the software, or as an executable file (typically an `.exe`) that you need to place next to Blender's own executable. Please follow one of the instruction sets below, depending on whether you have received a ZIP or an executable.

==== Installation from a ZIP file

This section applies if you have received a ZIP file from us.

1. Open Blender and go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons.
2. (optional) Activate the "User" filter for the add-ons.
3. Press the btn:[Install...] button on the top right.
4. In the popup window select the *Skybrush Studio for Blender* `.zip` file that you have downloaded previously to your computer, and press kbd:[Enter].
5. Activate the "Interface: Skybrush Studio" add-on by clicking on the checkbox next to this item in the add-on list.

==== Installation from an executable on Windows

This section applies if you have received an executable file (typically named `skybrush-blender-plugin-...-win64.exe`) from us.

1. Open the file manager of your operating system and copy the executable in the same folder where Blender is installed. Look for a file named `blender.exe` if you are uncertain.

2. Start the executable file you have received from us. This will in turn provide the code of our software to Blender and start it up.

== Installing updates

If you have already installed *Skybrush Studio for Blender* and you receive an update for it, simply follow the same installation procedure as before to overwrite old files with new ones.

NOTE: It might happen that the structure of the software also changes which might result in update failure. If you experience any error in the update process, try to completely uninstall the old add-on first manually (as described below) and then re-install the new one from scratch.

== Uninstallation

If you decide to uninstall *Skybrush Studio for Blender* for any reasons, you have to do it manually as Blender does not support uninstall procedure for add-ons officially for the time being. The manual process is as follows:

1. Open the file manager of your operating system and navigate to the folder containing Blender.
2. Find the original executable that we provided to you and remove it.
