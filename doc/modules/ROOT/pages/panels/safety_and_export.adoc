The Safety & Export tab in the sidebar of the Viewport editor lets you perform real-time verification of your drone animation and enables you to export your show into Skybrush Compiled format.

== Safety Check panel

The Safety Check panel lets you perform real-time frame-level or full post-processed verification of your drone animation to aid you towards completely safe drone flighs.

Safety warnings of the actual frame appear in real-time as text on the left side of the 3D Viewport editor, while errorous drones are also highlighted in real-time with red as seen in the image below.

To enable or disable all safety checks together, use the checkbox at the top left corner of the panel.

=== Proximity warnings

This option lets you define a minimum safety distance between your drones. If there are drones at the given frame that are closer to each other than this safety distance, you get real-time proximity warnings.

The text-based proximity warning on the left side of the 3D Viewport editor always shows you the minimum distance between all drone-pairs on the current frame. This drone pair is also highlighted with red, along with a red line connecting them.

To enable or disable proximity warnings, use the btn:[Show proximity warnings] checkbox.

=== Altitude warnings

This option lets you define a maximum altitude for your drone show. If there are drones above this altitude (measured along the `Z` axis), you get real-time altitude warnings.

The text-based altitude warning on the left side of the 3D Viewport editor always shows you the overall altitude range of drones on the current frame. Drones above the altitude threshold at a given frame are highlighted in red.

To enable or disable altitude warnings, use the btn:[Show altitude warnings] checkbox.

=== Velocity warnings

This option lets you define a maximum horizontal and vertical speed for your drone show. If there are drones above these velocity limits, you get real-time velocity warnings.

The text-based velocity warning on the left side of the 3D Viewport editor always shows you the maximum horizontal and vertical velocity of drones on the current frame. Drones above the velocity thresholds at a given frame are highlighted in red.

To enable or disable velocity warnings, use the btn:[Show velocity warnings] checkbox.

=== Validate Trajectories

Press the btn:[Validate Trajectories] button to get a full validation for a frame range, not just for a single frame (this might take some time depending on the number of your drones and the number of frames selected).

Once ready, you will receive a `.pdf` file containing detailed validation checks.

TIP: Interactive validation of the whole show is also possible in *Skybrush Viewer*. Check that out, too!


== Export panel

Once you are finished with your drone show, use the Export panel to export it from Blender to formats that can be uploaded to your drones.

=== Export to .skyc

The Skybrush Compiled format is a single-file descriptor of your complete drone show. It is used as the primary drone show format throughout the entire *Skybrush* suite:

* If you wish to visualize or verify your show or you simply want to send a link with an interactive 3D visualization of the show to your clients, use *Skybrush Viewer*.

* If you want to execute your drone show on your real drones, use *Skybrush Live*.

If you press the btn:[Export to .skyc] button, you have to choose the path and filename of your output file. There are also some parameters you can setup conveniently:

* Export all or only selected drones
* Define the frame range of the output (Render / Preview / Storyboard)
* Set output frame rate (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)
