The Safety & Export tab in the sidebar of the Viewport editor lets you perform real-time verification of your drone animation and enables you to export your show into Skybrush compiled (`.skyc`) format. If the Skybrush CSV export addon is enabled in Blender, it also allows you to export the sampled trajectories and lights in a set of zipped CSV files to allow further post-processing in external tools.
