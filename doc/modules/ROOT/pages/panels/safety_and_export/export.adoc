Once you are finished with your drone show, use the Export panel to export it from Blender to different formats for further processing or direct upload to the drones.

== Export to .skyc

The Skybrush compiled show format is a single-file descriptor of your complete drone show. It is used as the primary drone show format throughout the entire *Skybrush* suite:

* If you wish to visualize or verify your show or you simply want to send a link with an interactive 3D visualization of the show to your clients, use *Skybrush Viewer*.

* If you want to execute your drone show on your real drones, use *Skybrush Live*.

If you press the btn:[Export to .skyc] button, you have to choose the path and filename of your output file. There are also some parameters you can setup conveniently:

* Export all or only selected drones
* Define the frame range of the output (Render / Preview / Storyboard)
* Set output frame rate (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

== Export to .csv

The trajectories and LED light colors of the drones can also be sampled at regular intervals and exported to CSV files for further post-processing in external tools. This option appears only if you have installed and enabled the CSV export addon that is distributed separately. The CSV export will produce a single ZIP file that contains multiple CSV files, one for each drone, with the following columns: time (milliseconds), X, Y and Z coordinates (meters) and the red, green and blue components of the color of the LED light, in the usual 0-255 range.

TIP: We recommend using Skybrush Live for drone show control, together with the official Skybrush Compiled Format (.skyc), as it might contain a lot more information about your show in a lot more optimized way, then this simple baked .csv.

If you press the btn:[Export to .skyc] button, you have to choose the path and filename of your output file. There are also some parameters you can setup conveniently:

* Export all or only selected drones
* Define the frame range of the output (Render / Preview / Storyboard)
* Set output frame rate (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

NOTE: Special characters in drone names are converted to standard characters in the exported filenames.
