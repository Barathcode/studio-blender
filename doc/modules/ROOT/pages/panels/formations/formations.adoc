With the Formations panel of the Formations tab you can create, select, deselect, update or remove formations or you can add them to your storyboard.

== Selecting the active formation

Click on the btn:[Formation] button to select the formation to be edited in the Formations panel.

== Creating a new formation

The btn:[+] button creates a new formation. Remember that formations are essentially sub-collections in your Formations collection, consisting of (stationary or animated) markers that define the desired positions of the drones in a particular scene of your drone show.

You can define a name for your new formation and choose how it should be initialized:

Empty:: Creates an empty formation

Current positions of drones:: Creates a formation that contains one empty mesh for each drone, placed exactly at the current position of the drone. You can use this option to create a "snapshot" of the drone swarm at a given frame and use it again as a formation later on in the show.

Selected objects:: Creates a formation that _contains_ the currently selected objects. If the locations of the objects were animated, the formation will be animated as well. Removing any of these objects from the scene will also remove them from the formation.

Current positions of selected objects:: Creates a formation that contains one empty mesh for the position of each selected object. The empties are added to the formation, but the objects themselves are _not_ -- therefore, even if the objects were animated, the formation will only take a snapshot of the objects at the current frame. You are then free to remove the objects from the scene without affecting the formation.

Current positions of selected vertices:: Creates a formation that contains one empty mesh for the position of each selected _vertex_ of the currently edited object. This option is therefore mostly useful in Blender's edit mode only; in object mode, all vertices of the selected object will be placed in the formation.

== Removing a formation

Press the btn:[âœ•] button to remove the selected formation from the Formations list and the Formations collection entirely. Meshes that were part of the formation but that were _not_ referenced from anywhere else in the Blender scene will also be removed from the scene. If you want to keep them, put them in another collection first or by assigning them to a https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/controls/templates/data_block.html?highlight=fake%20user[fake user] in Blender.

== Select Formation

Press the btn:[Select] button to add the selected formation to the selection.

== Deselect Formation

Press the btn:[Deselect] button to remove the selected formation from the selection.

== Formation Statistics

Press the btn:[Stats] button to show different useful statistics about the selected formation, such as the number of its elements, size or minimum distance between its objects on the current frame.

== Append to Storyboard

Press the btn:[Append to Storyboard] button to append the selected formation to the end of the show, planning the transition between the last formation and the new one.

== Update

Press the btn:[Update] button to update the selected formation from the current selection or from the current positions of the drones.
