The LED Control panel provide a simple way to color your selected drones at individual keyframes.

== Primary color

Press on the left color field to set the primary color you would like to set on the selected drones. Selecting a color does not set color keyframes yet, it just indicates your desired color.

== Secondary color

Press on the right dcolor field to set the secondary color you would like to use in some light effects when coloring selected drones. Selecting a color does not set color keyframes yet, it just indicates your desired secondary color.

== Swap Colors

// Unicode arrow chars mostly not supported in PDF

Press the arrow button in between the primary and secondary color fields to swap the two colors.

== Apply / Fade to

The btn:[Apply] and btn:[Fade to] buttons below the selected primary and secondary colors open the same popup window with different default values corresponding to their function.

They insert color animation keyframes at the given frame for the selected drones, according to the settings in the popup window.

If the btn:[Fade to color] checkbox is disabled, one keyframe with the previous color is inserted right before the actual frame and one with the selected color is added to the current frame (resulting in abrupt color change at the given frame). If the chekcbox is enabled, only one color keyframe will be added at the current frame, but with linear interpolation on the left (from the past) from the previous color keyframe.

The "Color to apply" option lets you select which color to use, the primary, the secondary or as a more advanced feature, a gradient color between these two. If the gradient mode is selected (assuming that you have selected multiple drones to color), the "Order in gradient" option lets you define how the gradient coloring is performed (along a given axis, as a distance from the cursor etc.).

== Use Bloom Effect

Specifies whether the bloom effect should automatically be enabled on the 3D View.

The bloom effect gives you a nice realistic look with shiny drones, however it can be very misleading in terms of the final sensed color.
