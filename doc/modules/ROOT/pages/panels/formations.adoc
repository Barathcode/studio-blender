The Formations tab in the sidebar of the 3D Viewport editor helps you to organize your animations and formations into a drone show.

== Swarm panel

The swarm panel helps you setup your drone show with all technical parts that are not the sole responsibility of the drone show designer by default, such as the initial positions or the takeoff or landing procedures.

=== Max acceleration

The "Max acceleration" button sets up a maximal acceleration (in all directions) that is used by the automated motion planning functions of *Skybrush Studio*, for example when automatic transitions or transition times are calculated.

=== Create Takeoff Grid

The "Create Takeoff Grid" button helps you setup your takeoff and landing grid (they are expected to be the same by default).

You can define the number of rows and columns, the exact number of drones and the spacing between them. Once you press OK, a rectangular grid is created with the specified parameters.

This operator also creates all Skybrush-specific collections (Drones, Formations, Templates) that you will need for your drone show, and will also initialize your drones in the 3D Viewport editor.


== Formations panel

With the Formations panel of the Formations tab you can create, select, deselect, update or remove formations or you can add them to your Storyboard.

=== Create Formation

The "Create Formations" button creates sub-collections in your Formations collection, consisting of objects that are to be animated during a given scene of your drone show.

You can define a name for your new formation and select its source. The source can be the actually selected objects, the selected vertices of an object, current positions of your drones or even an animated vertex group of an object.

=== Formation

Click on this button to edit a given formation in the Formations panel.

=== Select

Add the selected formation to the selection.

=== Deselect

Removes the selected formation from the selection.

=== Append to Storyboard

Appends the selected formation to the end of the show, planning the transition between the last formation and the new one.

=== Update

Updates the selected formation from the current selection or from the current positions of the drones.

=== Remove

Removes the selected formation from the show.


== Storyboard panel

The Storyboard gives you the overall structure of your drone show, with your formations ordered in time.

=== Create New Storyboard Entry

Press the plus sign next to the formation list in the Storyboard to add a new entry to the end of the Storyboard.

=== Remove Selected Storyboard Entry

Press the minus sign next to the formation list in the Storyboard to remove the selected storyboard entry from the list.

=== Select Storyboard Entry for Current Frame

Press the arrow next to the formation list in the Storyboard to select the storyboard entry that contains the current frame. If the current frame falls between storyboard entries, selects the next entry. Clears the selection if the current frame is after the end of the storyboard.

=== Move Selected Storyboard Entry Up

Press the triangle pointing up next to the formation list in the Storyboard to move the selected entry up by one slot in the Storyboard.

=== Move Selected Storyboard Entry Down

Press the triangle pointing down next to the formation list in the Storyboard to move the selected entry down by one slot in the Storyboard.

=== Formation

Select a formation corresponding the the selected Storyboard entry.

=== Start Frame

Set the frame when the given formation should start in the drone show.

=== Duration

Set the duration of the given formation in the drone show. The end frame of the formation will be `Start Frame + Duration`.

=== Transition

Set the type of transition between the previous formation and this one. Manual transitions map the nth vertex of the initial formation to the nth vertex of the target formation. Auto-matched transitions find an optimal mapping between vertices of the initial and the target formation.

=== Custom Name

If you check this, you can keep the name of the Storyboard entry when the associated formation changes.

=== Recalculate Transitions

Once you are satisfied with your storyboard, you can press the "Recalculate Transitions" button to create automatic and optimal transitions between your formations without collisions.

This button also creates the constraints on your drones in your Drones collection to follow the given formations during their active time.
