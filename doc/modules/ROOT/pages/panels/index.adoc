*Skybrush Studio Plugin for Blender* creates several new panels in the sidebar of the 3D Viewport editor. These panels contain all the main operations that you will need specifically for your drone show design.

We encourage you to exploit the standard possibilities of Blender to create your animation scenes, and use these features to setup your drone show based on them, conveniently, in short time.

To aid your drone show design, the following panels are available currently:

* xref:panels/formations.adoc[Formations]
* xref:panels/leds.adoc[LEDs]
* xref:panels/safety_export.adoc[Safety & Export]
